## Architecture
- Pages live in `src/pages` and are mounted by thin TanStack route files in `src/routes`; `src/lib/router.ts` derives the app's `Route` union from the TanStack location for nav highlighting — keep both in sync when adding a page.
- Plain `<a href="/...">` links are intercepted in `__root.tsx` and routed client-side; `navigateTo()` uses the registered router. Why: the code came from a hash-router app and relies on plain anchors.
- TMDB calls go through `callTmdbServer` (`src/lib/tmdb.functions.ts`) so the API token stays server-side.
- Admin access uses the `admin_users` table and `is_cinema_admin()`; the first signed-in user can claim admin via `claim_first_admin()`.
